# PuzzleSolving

PuzzleSolving is a Python project that uses AI and GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) to generate and solve 3x3 sliding puzzles. It includes a graphical interface for visualizing puzzle solutions and supports both puzzle generation and solving.

## Features

- Generate random or AI-generated 3x3 sliding puzzles
- Solve puzzles using the A* search algorithm
- Train a GAN to generate new puzzle configurations
- Visualize puzzle solutions step-by-step with a Pygame interface

## Requirements

- Python 3.12
- numpy
- tensorflow
- matplotlib
- pygame

## Installation

1. Install Python 3.12 from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3120/).
2. Install the required packages using pip:

   ```bash
